        <div>The English Reformation's religious impact was greater than its political impact. It was caused by a series of events, but all of these can be traced back to a man by the name of <a href = "Martin Luther.html">Martin Luther</a>. <a href = "Martin Luther.html">Martin Luther</a> wrote the 95 Theses, which sparked great debates within all of the Christian Kingdoms of Europe. New interpretations of the Bible were presented, which mostly differed with others, and this caused conflict. Protestantism was founded, and new denominations came with it. Old beliefs, such as the belief that the purchase of papal indulgences was needed to relieve a soul of a place known as purgatory, were discarded.</div>
        <div style = "margin-top:25px;"><a href = "King Henry VIII.html">King Henry VIII</a>, like many other leaders in Europe, took advantage of the Protestant Reformation to make some changes. Henry VIII founded a new Church in England, which was called the Anglican Church. The Church was made for a variety of reasons, moreso political than religious, but would later make many significant changes in favor of Protestantism.</div>
        <div style = "margin-top:25px;">As a result, many <a href = "Significant Religious Changes.html">significant religious changes</a> were made in Early Modern England, with new denominations being made as well as the <a href = "Justice System.html">legal system undergoing changes</a> in accordance with new Protestant beliefs and interpretations of the Bible.</div>
