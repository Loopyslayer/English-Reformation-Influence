<div style = "width:900px;margin-left:150px">Martin Luther was originally a law student, but came to hate the profession. One day, Luther ended up in a storm was struck down by lightning, then cried out; "Help me, Saint Anne! I'll become a monk!" Luther ended up surviving the storm and thoughout the next fortnight, withdrew from the university and joined an Augustinian monastery (CrashCourse).</div>
<div class = "txt1">In 1505, Luther went to Rome on a diplomatic mission. The streets of Rome were ridden with prostitutes and priests not taking their duties seriously. Luther was enraged by this, and went searching for answers. Luther found an answer in St. Paul's epistles, about how "the just shall live by faith (CrashCourse)."</div>
<div class = "txt1">Luther then went on to publish the <i>Ninety-Five Theses</i> speaking out against the sale of indulgences, saying that only faith was needed for salvation. Indulgences were essentially donations to the Church with the promise from the Pope that it would reduce a soul's time in Purgatory. This sparked much debate, with Luther's stance becoming more radical over time.</div>
<div class = "txt1">The main reason for why Luther was so successful in criticizing the Church was the printing press. This caused many copies of the <i>Ninety-Five Theses</i> to spread all across Europe. In 1530, Luther's most influential effect on Europe was likely their publishing of the Bible in the vernacular language, German. Because of this, new interpretations of the Bible were made. Martin Luther influenced Early Modern England by inspiring <a href = "King Henry VIII.html">King Henry VIII</a> to found the Anglican Church (Rex).</div>
