        <div>Early Modern England's justice system was fundimentally corrupt. It had gone through many significant changes during the English Reformation in accordance with new beliefs and interpretations of the Bible forming. These changes stem from <a href = "King Henry VIII.html">King Henry VIII</a>.</div>
        <div class = "rtxt">When <a href = "King Henry VIII.html">Henry VIII</a> passed the Act of Supremacy, Popes were no longer in power, and so <a href = "King Henry VIII.html">Henry VIII</a> could divorce their first wife Catherine and remarry without needing the permission of the Pope. A side effect of this was that the Pope could no longer sell indulgences in England. This was significant because indulgences were papers that the Pope sold in order to pardon people. This meant that people had to find different methods of avoiding punishment (Henry VIII).</div>
        <div class = "rtxt">Early Modern England had a justice system that mainly used informers and coroners. Informers were individuals willing to report people, while coroners were established officers that reviewed cases of homicide. Both informers and coroners were paid by case, which only encouraged corruption in the executive branch. Informers would cooperate with criminals by receiving payment in exchange that they informers turn a blind eye. Coroners made malicious accusations so that they could make more money (Sharpe).</div>
        <div class = "rtxt">These dubious practices occurred frequently because these law enforcers could not read the Bible as it was written in Latin. This changed when <a href = "King Henry VIII.html">King Henry VIII</a> officially published the Bible in English (Rex). This meant that many more people could read the Bible and interpret it at any time instead of needing a priest to do so.</div>
