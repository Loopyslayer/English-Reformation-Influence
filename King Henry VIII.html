            <div>The English Reformation caused many religious changes to take place in Early Modern England. King Henry VIII was arguably the most religiously influential monarch of England during the English Reformation due to a variety of changes that they directly or indirectly caused.</div>
            <div class = "rtxt">King Henry VIII passed the Act of Supremacy in 1534, which cut ties with the Roman Catholic Church and founded England's very own Anglican Church. A few years after in 1539, King Henry VIII officially published the Great Bible, which was written in English (Rex). This was influenced by <a href = "Martin Luther.html">Martin Luther</a>'s publishing of the Bible in German, and just like Luther's Bible, it sparked much religious change. This English translation of the Bible went on to change how England's justice system operated and how people interpreted the Bible.</div>
            <div class = "rtxt">With the founding of the Anglican Church, the concurrent and future monarchs of England were permitted to divorce at a whim (Henry VIII). This was extremely significant since the Bible emphasized that marriage was supposed to be for life. “What therefore God has joined together, let man not separate (The Holy Bible).” The ability to divorce was a significant doctrinal change, and one that challenged the Catholic sacrament of marriage.</div>
