        <div class = "rtxt">Early Modern England went through many significant religious changes, a lot of which were in thanks to the monarch who reigned during the English Reformation: <a href = "King Henry VIII.html">King Henry VIII</a>. The religious change ultimately began with the Act of Supremacy being passed in 1534, which made it so that all the King was the Supreme Head of the Church of England instead of the Pope. The Church of England was also separated from the Roman Catholic Church, becoming its own Church called the Anglican Church (Henry VIII).</div>
        <div class = "rtxt">Many Roman Catholic doctrines, such as the <u title = "penance (voluntary self punishment), baptism, confirmation, ordination (confession), marriage, extreme unction, and the Eucharist">Seven Sacraments of Catholicism</u> were questioned during the English Reformation in one way or another. It was argued whether regular bread or a decorated wafer was to be used at the Eucharist. Parliament permitted clerics to marry in 1549, which was significant because clerics were meant to be the devout religious leaders of the Christian people. King Henry VIII, despite being raised Catholic, was openly skeptical about the existence of Purgatory (Doran).</div>
        <div class = "rtxt">Not all of the Roman Catholic doctrines were forsaken in the Anglican Church though. For example, the ring in marriage was still given and the cross in baptism was still performed (Doran).</div>
